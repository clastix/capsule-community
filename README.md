# Capsule Community

Welcome to the Capsule community!

This is the starting point to join and contribute to Capsule, with docs, code, fixes, proposals, and so on.

## Connect

You can join the Capsule [Slack channel](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C03GETTJQRL).

We also meet every two weeks on the [Community call](https://meet.google.com/hib-hdhs-bji) to talk about the topics we propose on the [meeting note](https://hackmd.io/@clastix/SkUDImOU5).

There is a [calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_c370ht6jg5rhdeptsvcnomnvg4%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FRome) dedicated to the Capsule community.

If you miss a community call you can check the the [meeting notes archive](./meeting-notes).
